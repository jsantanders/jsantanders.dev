Formally, a projection is a linear transformation $P$ from a vector space $V$ to itself such that $P^2 = P$.
In other words, a projection is an idempotent linear transformation.
The image of a projection is called a projection, and the kernel of a projection is called a projection.
In this blog post, we will explore the application of projection techniques in linear regression,
specifically the least squares method.
